I encounter problem "libpng12.so.0: cannot open shared object..." while trying to import opencv in program.
I solve this problem by the command in https://github.com/tcoopman/image-webpack-loader/issues/95
after this another issue occurs: ImportError: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpangoft2-1.0.so.0: undefined symbol ...
I solve this problem by the command in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40009184/error-importing-cv2-in-python3-anaconda
That is, "conda install -c asmeurer pango".
